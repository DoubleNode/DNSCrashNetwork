## Requirements

-   iOS 13.0+ / macOS 10.15+ / tvOS 13.0+ / watchOS 6.0+
-   Xcode 11.6+
-   Swift 5.1+

## Installation

### Swift Package Manager

The [Swift Package Manager](https://swift.org/package-manager/) is a tool for automating the distribution of Swift code and is integrated into the `swift` compiler. It is in early development, but Alamofire does support its use on supported platforms.

Once you have your Swift package set up, adding Alamofire as a dependency is as easy as adding it to the `dependencies` value of your `Package.swift`.

```swift
dependencies: [
.package(url: "https://github.com/DoubleNode/DNSCrashNetwork.git", from: "1.10.1")
]
```

## Dependencies

-   Alamofire v5.6.2+
-   DNSBlankNetwork v1.10.1+
-   DNSCore v1.10.48+
-   DNSDataObjects v1.10.80+
-   DNSError v1.10.0+
-   DNSProtocols v1.10.89+
